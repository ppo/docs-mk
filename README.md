# DocsMk

Template and CLI tool to manage a standalone [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation.


## Install

**Prerequisites:** Python 3, Git, Bash.

In your project folder, clone this project (or fork it first)…

```
git clone git@github.com:ppo/docsmk.git
./docsmk/docsmk install
```

#### This will

- Create a Python3 virtualenv (`python3 -m venv ./docsmk/.venv`).
- Install the required pip packages (see `requirements.txt`).
- Create the documentation directory (`./docs`); unless it already exists.

#### Remark

If you plan to keep it versioned, don't forget to either:

1) Delete the .git directory of this project:

```
rm -fr ./docsmk/.git
```

2) Change it to your repository:

```
cd docsmk
git remote set-url origin git@example.com:<YOU>/<YOUR_REPO>.git
```

## Deployment

### Read The Docs

1. Move the `.readthedocs.yml` file to the root of your repository. No modifications required.
2. Import your project via [your dashboard on RTD](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/).
3. That's it! The building process starts automatically.
   Click on “your documentation is building” to follow its progress.

And it will be automatically rebuild when changes are committed to the repository.


**Known Problem:**

If you don't see the projects of an organization in RTD, you've to explicitely grant them access
to that organization.
See [Requesting organization approval for OAuth Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps).
